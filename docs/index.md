# Overview

## Course Description

The purpose of this course is to teach the theory and practical use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  Major components of the course include computer representation of geographic information, the construction of GIS databases, spatial analysis with GIS, application areas of GIS, and social and management issues that concern GIS.  At the end of the course the student is expected to have an understanding of elementary GIS theory, working knowledge of ArcGIS Pro, and the ability to develop GIS-based solutions to geographic modeling and analysis tasks.

Note that this is not just a software training course! You will indeed finish the course with advanced skills in GIS software. However, broader learning objectives for this course include general scientific literacy and graphicacy (the understanding and creation of maps and other graphic representations), as well as developing critical thinking skills.

## Prerequisites

There are no course prerequisites; however a working knowledge of Windows and basic file management is expected.

## Text

This course will make use of *GIS Fundamentals, 6e*, by Paul Bolstad. The book is on order with the campus bookstore, and also available directly from the publisher at <https://www.xanedu.com/higher-education/educators/custom-books-catalog/gis_fundamentals_6e/>. The publisher sells it in both paper and ebook formats. It contains more material than we will cover, but is fairly inexpensive, and worth keeping as a reference.
